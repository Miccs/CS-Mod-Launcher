# Cave Story Mod launcher
An old project made in 2018 for the purpose of having a tool that would allow you to easily get a list of your mods and play/config/update them.
Includes my cave story config project if there isn't an existing listed doconfig, which includes a font picker.

Made when I barely had an idea of programming properly.

For use however people want so long as it's not used maliciously.

## How to use
Put the executable in the root folder of wherever you save your mods.
