# Cave Story Mod launcher
An old project made in 2018 for the purpose of having a tool that would allow you to easily get a list of your mods and play/config/update them.
Includes my cave story config project if there isn't an existing listed doconfig, which includes a font picker.

Made when I barely had an idea of programming properly.

For use however people want so long as it's not used maliciously.

## How to use
Unzip the executable wherever you like.
When launching the program for the first time, you will be asked to set a mod folder which you can use as default folder for scanning mods or auto-installing mods.
This folder can be configured with the 'Set mod folder...' under the 'File' tab.

Through the detect options under the 'File' tab you can automatically fill the modlist with mods that have a ModInfo.json file in their folder.
You can also automatically install downloaded mods by dragging the zip file to the program window, and mods in existing folders can be added through 'File>Add new mod...'.
Both these options generate ModInfo.json files, which you can edit by selecting them on the list and pressing 'Edit', after which you can choose to include them in your mod.
